		<h3>Tools for Dealing with Depression/Anxiety<br></h3>
		<p>
			If you are stuggling with Depression/Anxiety, here are some tips to help
		</p>
		
		<ul>
  			<li>
				<b>Do Things Scared:</b> The most basic of ways to overcome/lessen anxiety is to do things anxious. You are scared, and that’s okay, try to do the scary thing anyway. 
				You can do it in small steps, but you should do it. 
				You can see this in things like exposure therapy, to desensitize triggers, as well as avoiding developing negative reinforcement. 
				If you don’t do a thing, and feel relieved, your brain learns that that is the correct action when presented with a scary thing, entrenching your anxiety.
			</li>
  			<li>
				<b>Break the Cycle:</b> Your brain can develop habits of thought, resulting in triggers of anxiety or depression. 
				Whenever presented with one of these thoughts or triggers, it is easiest to do the thing you’ve always done. However, you can make new habits as well. 
				When you hear or think “I’m not good enough” or “I can’t do that” you can focus on things you’ve done that are good and act as counter-evidence to those thoughts. 
				Those thoughts are your enemies, and fight them, do not let them win.
			</li>
  			<li>
				<b>Identify Triggers:</b> While this can be difficult, if you can figure out what causes you to feel the way you do, you can prepare yourself when you know you will be confronted by one. 
				This is vital to avoid staying lodged in a rut.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Utilize “grounding techniques”:</b> While it can be tempting to think about the future and then all the things that can go wrong, 
				it is important to remember that you are not in the future dealing with those possibilities. 
				The future is complicated and hard to predict, many people are paid millions of dollars to be wrong about it. 
				If it is not certain/if there’s nothing you can do to avoid a scenario, it does not help to worry about it. “Do not borrow grief from tomorrow”. 
				Examples of such are:
				<ul>
					<li>
						5,4,3,2,1: Focus on 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can touch, 2 things you can hear, 
						and 1 thing you can taste. Focusing on this sensory data can distract from stressful thoughts
					</li>
					<li>
						Grounding Items: Keep an interesting sensory item, like a special rock or a fidget toy to ground your body/focus on your hands.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Stay healthy:</b> While it may seem silly, many neurological issues can stem from physiological issues impacting hormones. 
				For that reason it’s important to make sure you are remaining healthy physically to give your brain the opportunity to improve. 
				Important elements include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Eating a balanced diet 
						(figuring out what works best for you - some people do better if they eat 5 small well-balanced meals per day while others are healthier with 3 meals a day.
					</li>
					<li>
						Making sure you are getting enough sleep (7-9 hours)
					</li>
					<li>
						Exercising regularly (try to pick some methods you enjoy - biking/swimming/dancing/walking with friends or loved ones/etc)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Regulate your schedule:</b> Your brain often releases hormones in preparation for events, a notable example is dopamine, 
				often released prior to a good event rather than during it. These preparative hormones are impacted by an unregulated schedule, 
				interrupting important routines that can be the root of some amount of depression. Regulating your schedule so your body knows to 
				prepare for sleep, prepare for eating, and prepare for exercise helps it avoid the drawbacks and properly account for them.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Speak with a friend/family member/doctor/mental health professional/or support group:</b> Often Anxiety/Depression stems from a feeling of 
				isolation or being unique in your struggles, and realizing others suffer similarly can counterintuitively relieve some stress. 
				In addition sometimes the feelings being bottled up also causes stress, and speaking them out loud releases them. Also your community 
				may have additional tips or helpful suggestions that I as a single person cannot provide from here.
