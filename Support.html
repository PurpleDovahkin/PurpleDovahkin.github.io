		<h3>Support For Those Being Harmed By Suicidal Thoughts/Actions</h3>
		<p>
			<b>If you are thinking about suicide yourself, please know this:</b>
      <ul id="selfList">
        <li>You are NOT a burden (your mind is lying to you)</li>
        <li>Your feelings are valid, you are worthy of being heard, and you deserve to be helped</li>
        <li>Everyone has mental health issues, many people hide them, never feel badly about struggling to get through a day</li>
        <li>You are not alone - life is complicated and hard</li>
        <li>Ask for help - there is no shame in needing help!</li>
        <li>There are people who want to help you - friends/family/doctors/medical healthy professionals/emergency services/crisis lines - call or text 988 24 hours a day/7 days a week.</li>
        <li>No one walks in your shoes, so please share what is going on so that your loved ones can help you, or get help for you</li>
        <li>No one knows when you will feel better, what that will look like for you --- but when you read the writings of those who survive suicide attempts, they talk about the lies with which suicide fills your mind - ultimately, they say that they are glad that suicide did not win and that they are here</li>
        <li>Your loved ones will never get over the loss of you, and some even die because they can not withstand the pain, grief, loneliness, and loss of you</li>
        <li>You make the world a better place and it is colder and darker and much more barren and cruel without you</li>
        <li>You are you - there one and only you there is - and when you are gone there will never be another you</li>
        <li>You ARE enough - You ARE NEVER too much - You ARE needed - SO PLEASE STAY</li>
      </ul>
		</p>
    <p>
			<b>If you fear that your loved one is considering suicide, please know this: </b>
      <ul id="otherList">
        <li>Be there for them genuinely and with unconditional love</li>
        <li>Be prepared for tough conversations - that are worth every moment of time and energy</li>
        <li>Ask your loved one directly if they are thinking about suicide and if they say yes, ask them if they have a plan in mind of how to carry out that suicide.</li>
        <li>LISTEN TO THEM - REALLY LISTEN</li>
        <li>Respond compassionately without judgement/do not lecture them</li>
        <li>Ask questions as appropriate but donâ€™t interrupt - let them share what is going on inside of them</li>
        <li>Let them know that they are not alone and that they are not a burden (tell them that you would rather they talk to you - in person or on the phone - about their worries, fears, anger, or whatever they want to talk about 1,000,000 times than die by suicide and be gone forever.)</li>
        <li>Encourage your loved one to speak to a trusted adult (if they are a minor), a doctor, mental health provider, emergency services, or a crisis line. </li>
        <li>If your loved one asks you not to tell anyone try to explain why you must - then even if your friend is angry with you later - it is better to face that anger than lose your loved one to death by suicide.</li>
        <li>If you are worried that they are in danger of carrying out a suicidal plan DO NOT leave them unattended and call for help yourself</li>
        <li>Each situation is different - not all crises look or feel the same - if you think that it is a crisis call and seek aid for your loved one </li>
        <li>Call or text <a href="tel:988">988</a> anytime 24 hour a day/7 days a week</li>
      </ul>
