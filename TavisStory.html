		<h3><br>Tavi's Story</h3>
		<p>
			This is the story of one of the best people I've ever known. I am inclined first to describe her as she 
			was, for the people who never had the privilege to know her. She was resolute, determined, and kind and 
			a million other adjectives - there aren’t enough to capture the   When in disagreements or fights, she 
			would always represent the disenfranchised - the people who are normally overlooked or dismissed. She 
			even defended our father despite his almost constant absence. She had a knack with words which I have 
			never had - she would have been such an enormous help writing this project. Resolute - that world rolls 
			around in my head - it really describes one of her facets so well, I have never been the best at 
			transitions and this subject matter doesn’t lend itself to making transitions any easier - It is 
			impossible to know where to start when one wants to express an entire human being. She loved rainbows 
			and unicorns and wanted to be a vet when she grew up - it was always her inclination to help.She had 
			just begun photography, and she had an eye, that once again I simply don’t - the lighting, the angle - 
			she had the natural nack and a great idea of how to represent something in photos - and she was only 
			just starting. She had begun to adopt some of my hobbies - video games, critiquing animation, she had 
			even taken the first step and got us all to watch The Rise of the Teenage Ninja Turtles - something I 
			had read good things about but had never watched. She wasn’t content to take someone else’s word for 
			something - she had to experience or read or watch things for herself - she wanted to make sure that 
			she was getting and then sharing the truth. She was impeccably honest regardless of the cost. She 
			examined things and studied things in-depth. She sought equity, respect, compassion, and kindness for 
			everyone - and would stand up for the underdog even when that made her own life harder at school or in 
			the community. She was so many things in one person - she gave amazing hugs - she hugged me and my mom 
			and my other little sister everyday. She never went to bed without saying Goodnight, giving hugs, 
			wishing us sweet dreams, and telling us that she loved us.And still she was more than that too -
