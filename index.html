		<h1>Tavi's Story</h1>
		<p>
			This page is dedicated to an amazing individual lost to the pandemic of suicide. No matter who or when or where, it is always a tragedy, and whatever can be done to disuade people and stem the flow is worthy of trying.
			If you are considering or know someone who is please contact <a href="tel:911">911</a> or the <a href="tel:988">Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> I promise you will crush people you likely don't intend to.
			This page is still under construction/will be updated as more tips reach my attention/as I have the heart to add detail to the story of Tavi.
